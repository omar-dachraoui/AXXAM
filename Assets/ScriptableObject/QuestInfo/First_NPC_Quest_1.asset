    our village?
  - May the wisdom of our ancestors guide us through this darkness

    distant even. Would you be willing to investigate? Your keen eyes and swift feet
    may uncover the truth hidden in the shadows

    guide you in uncovering the truth.

    other matters first

    find yourself with the time and inclination to aid our village,
